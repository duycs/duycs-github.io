  This is a book that I have been given by Gisoft, the SOLID inscription on the cover of the book. Many thanks to the friends at GiSoft.

## Concepts
### Single responsibility principle
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

### Openâ€“closed principle
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

### Liskov substitution principle
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

### Interface segregation principle
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

### Dependency inversion principle
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
